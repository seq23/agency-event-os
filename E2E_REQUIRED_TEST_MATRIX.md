## Required Tier 4 E2E: Attendee Live Consumption

The live event outcome requires an attendee live-consumption gauntlet. A provider ladder test alone is not sufficient. The gauntlet must prove attendee entry, live token consumption, permit/revoke/re-permit, backend logs, refresh/re-entry-ready persistence surfaces, and no secret exposure.
