# Hostile Review + Master Addendum Crosscheck — agency-event-os

Status: ACTIVE
Date: 2026-06-11

Purpose: static delivery-gate review before packaging. This document maps the repo-owned test completion batch against the hostile review plan and the Master Addendum. It does not claim browser/provider/deployment proof.

## Crosscheck matrix

| Forbidden roles and protected routes | PRESENT / NOT RUN | Role gates/access-boundary suites plus edge suite are present. |

| Real StreamYard Custom RTMP to LiveKit media | PRESENT AS LIVE PROOF LANE / UNPROVEN | tests/e2e/real-streamyard-livekit-media.spec.ts requires real broadcast + LiveKit creds. |
| Postdeploy role/provider proof | PRESENT AS POSTDEPLOY LANE / UNPROVEN | tests/e2e/postdeploy-role-provider-critical.spec.ts requires deployed URL. |

## Delivery lock

- Static hostile/Master Addendum crosscheck must pass before ZIP packaging.
- `npm run validate:e2e-coverage` must pass before ZIP packaging.
- `npm run validate:everything -- --tier=1` must pass before ZIP packaging.
- COMPLETE remains blocked until browser, provider, postdeploy, and human-review layers actually run and pass.
