## 1. Rules of use

| Rule | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Treat this as private owner material | It contains passwords and event access codes. |
| Use canonical domain for operations | Use `https://westpeek.live` for owner/operator/crew/guest/public paths. |
| Keep worker URL as fallback only | Use `https://west-peek-live.seq-taylor.workers.dev` only if canonical routing/DNS needs troubleshooting. |
| Do not email/post this packet publicly | Share only with owner-approved operators. |
| Do not commit this packet | This file belongs in private owner storage, not the repo. |
| Do not paste passwords into public tickets | Reference the role/code name instead. |

## 11. Video provider and failure-plane matrix

| Layer | Provider / tool | Purpose | Failure plane | Operator rule |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Production feed/source | StreamYard | Host/producer feed source | Production-feed failure | Keep StreamYard conceptually separate from LiveKit |
| Primary embedded event engine/distribution | LiveKit | Main embedded attendee experience | Distribution/runtime failure | Primary viewer layer |
| Secondary embedded fallback | Daily | Embedded backup when primary distribution has trouble | Fallback distribution failure | Use when LiveKit distribution is unhealthy |
| White-label backup rooms | Zoom + Google Meet | Last-resort continuity links | External-room continuity | Backup links only; not core event engine |
| Attendee stage/player | West Peek Live app | Attendee-facing stage shell | App/player UX | Should show branded states, not raw technical failure |
| Operator testing console | Admin/testing | Provider decisioning and route/runtime checks | Ops visibility | Use to diagnose before switching |

**Do not collapse these concepts:**  
StreamYard is the production feed/source. LiveKit is the embedded event distribution layer. Daily is the embedded fallback. Zoom/Google Meet are backup continuity links.

---

## 12. Speaker materials and teleprompter intake

Speaker materials have one producer review queue. Intake path can vary; destination must not vary.

| Intake path | Who uses it | What happens | Show-day rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| Speaker self-serve | Speaker | Speaker opens `/speaker/events/[eventId]/teleprompter` and submits teleprompter notes, deck links, or supporting document links. | Preferred path. Nothing goes live until producer review. |
| hello@ email fallback | Speaker or assistant | Operator/crew copies the email summary or file link into the speaker material intake panel on the event approval queue. | Email is not the system of record; the producer queue is. |
| Crew/operator upload or handoff | Crew, operator, producer | Crew/operator records the handoff in the same speaker material intake panel. | Use when a speaker sends a file by text, Drive, Slack, or live handoff. |

Operational rule: materials may arrive through self-serve, hello@ email, or crew/operator handoff, but they must end in the event-specific producer review queue before teleprompter/deck/show materials are changed. Speakers cannot directly publish script, slide, or teleprompter changes to the live show.

## 13. Validation proof matrix

| Proof layer | Latest result | What it proves | What it does not prove |
|---|---|---|---|
| TypeScript typecheck | PASS | Type contracts compile | Does not prove browser behavior |
| Lint | PASS | No lint errors/warnings | Does not prove runtime behavior |
| Unit tests | PASS — 61 files / 138 tests | Core service/rule behavior passed | Does not prove full browser journeys |
| v5 hard validators | PASS | Static/security/route/env contracts passed | Does not prove user behavior by itself |
| v7 validators | PASS | Day 1 route/UX/operator packet contracts passed | Does not prove live manual usability |
| Deploy parity validators | PASS | Static deploy/runtime contracts passed | Does not prove DNS/canonical manually |
| Headed Playwright | PASS — 49 passed / 1 skipped / 0 failed | Local headed browser journeys passed for covered flows | Does not equal human exploratory QA |
| Cloudflare/OpenNext build | PASS | Production worker bundle builds | Does not prove all external providers work |
| Cloudflare deploy | PASS | Worker deployed successfully | Does not prove canonical DNS if not smoked separately |
| Worker postdeploy smoke | PASS | Worker URL responds through postdeploy smoke | Does not prove every live route manually |
| GitHub push | PASS — `8e7a3a9..f967934` | GitHub main updated | Does not prove CI, because no push workflow exists |

---

## 14. Known proof limits

| Limit | Current status | Practical meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Manual exploratory QA | Not performed in latest pass | A human has not manually clicked every live flow and judged visual/copy quality. |
| Canonical-domain smoke | Not separately logged in latest pass | Use canonical domain operationally; worker smoke is the logged postdeploy proof. |
| Real provider sessions with live secrets | Not proven by this packet | Tests prove safe failure/provider decisioning, not full LiveKit/Daily/Zoom/Google Meet live sessions. |
| Push-triggered GitHub Actions | Not available | Repo currently has only manual `workflow_dispatch` event-config workflow. |
| Secret values | Not printed/read by validators | Validators prove names/contracts, not secret value correctness. |

---

## 15. Troubleshooting matrix

| Symptom | Likely cause | First action |
|---|---|---|
| Canonical domain does not load | DNS/custom domain issue | Try worker fallback `https://west-peek-live.seq-taylor.workers.dev` |
| Worker works but canonical does not | Domain routing issue | Check Cloudflare route/custom domain binding |
| Operator gate loops to launchpad | Normal after successful login | Use Launchpad links or go directly to desired protected path |
| Special guest sees gate instead of portal | Wrong event code/code mismatch/expired cookie | Re-enter event code and role-specific password |
| Speaker/sponsor/client reaches wrong portal | Wrong role code | Use the correct role-specific code from the matrix |
| Crew can see crew pages but not operator pages | Expected boundary | Use Operator Gate only for operator-level actions |
| Video token routes return 403 without secrets | Safe failure | Confirm provider secrets if live provider session is required |
| Postdeploy smoke fails | Deployment or runtime route issue | Re-run worker URL smoke and inspect first failing route |
| GitHub Actions shows no runs | No push workflow exists | This is expected unless a push workflow is added later |

---

## 16. Worker fallback reference

Use this only for technical fallback or deployment verification.

| Purpose | Worker URL |
|---|---|
| Worker base | `https://west-peek-live.seq-taylor.workers.dev` |
| Production Access Hub | `https://west-peek-live.seq-taylor.workers.dev/production-access` |
| Owner Gate | `https://west-peek-live.seq-taylor.workers.dev/production-access/owner` |
| Operator Gate | `https://west-peek-live.seq-taylor.workers.dev/production-access/operator` |
| Crew Gate | `https://west-peek-live.seq-taylor.workers.dev/production-access/crew` |
| Special Guest Gate | `https://west-peek-live.seq-taylor.workers.dev/production-access/special-guest` |
| Demo Event | `https://west-peek-live.seq-taylor.workers.dev/events/demo` |
| Demo Venue Lobby | `https://west-peek-live.seq-taylor.workers.dev/venue/demo/lobby` |
| Demo Testing Console | `https://west-peek-live.seq-taylor.workers.dev/admin/testing/demo` |

---

## 17. Private environment reference

The companion file `west-peek-live-private-owner-env-vars.txt` contains the environment reference for off-repo owner storage.

Do not commit that file to GitHub. If using it locally, copy values into `.env.local` only temporarily, then remove local/generated artifacts before validation/deploy.

Local use:

```bash
cp /secure/path/west-peek-live-private-owner-env-vars.txt .env.local
```

Before validation/deploy:

```bash
rm -f .env.local
rm -rf .open-next .next .wrangler .runtime-data test-results playwright-report
```

---

## 18. Final Day 1 rule

Use the packet like this:

1. **Operator runs the show from the Operator Gate and Launchpad.**
2. **Crew uses Crew Gate only.**
3. **Speakers/sponsors/clients/VIPs use Special Guest Gate only.**
4. **Public attendees use public event/join/registration routes only.**
5. **Use canonical domain first.**
6. **Use worker URL only as fallback/technical proof.**
7. **Do not publish or commit this private packet.**
